# OmniMotion
A full-stack application that allows you to "Just Dance" to anything. 

## How It Works
Using Google's MediaPipe ML library, the application is able to track the movements of both the user (via their webcam) and an individual from an uploaded video. The software
then analyzes the movements to track the relative similarity between the user and the video, assigning a corresponding score based on the user's performance.
